## ABOUT

This is a fork of the cordova opentok plugin (https://github.com/opentok/cordova-plugin-opentok)
At the time of the fork (June 2021), the latest release of the plugin was not compatible with the latest Andriod and IOS SDKs
There was an existing PR fixing the issue that had not been merged yet (https://github.com/opentok/cordova-plugin-opentok/pull/204)

In the future we should consider moving back to the original plugin once it has been updated

Below is the original README# Cordova Plugin for OpenTok iOS and Android

> **Disclaimer:** This plugin is based on the [Cordova OpenTok Plugin](https://github.com/opentok/cordova-plugin-opentok/). Please keep in mind that this is an OpenTok Labs project which means that it's not officially supported by Vonage.

## Getting Started on your Project:

All your editing will be done in your www folder.

To use the opentok library, make sure you include `opentok.js` file in your HTML document.

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="opentok.js"></script>
```

All JavaScript code should be written in `onDeviceReady` function in `/js/index.js` because it is executed after all dependencies has loaded.

    }
